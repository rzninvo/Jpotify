# Jpotify
A **Spotify Clone** created with Java Swing.  
Music player application written in Java with features like Playlists, Shared Playlist and Friends Activity.

In order for us to completely mimic Spotify's GUI we had to rewrite some libraries of Java Swing like implementing a modern Java Swing Window Frame or a Custom Scrollbar.

# Here are some project runs!
